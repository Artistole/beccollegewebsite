        <div className="text-md ml-5 font-normal m-3 border-solid md:border-2  bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">
        <p >The College is continuing its efforts to have collaborative research with industries. An Industry-Institution-Interaction Cell (I-I-I-C) is established in the College to look at purposeful interaction between Industry and institution. The prime objectives of IIIC is facilitating the joint research work, consultancy for faculty and students, Conducting industrial exhibitions within the institution, facilitating the professionals from Industry to work as visiting faculty in institutions, and short or long period deployment of faculty from institutions to Industry for gaining industrial experience and/or work on projects in Industry.
        </p>
        <p >It has so far written MOUs with nine industries and two more re in pipeline. College is collaborating with them for research projects which may be development of an automobile accessory design, an IOT design and fabrication, software development for new applications, etc. Our student and teachers take up the project from May this year to May next year which may involve a six to eight week internship, first semester preparation work and the second semester full time work either at the industry or at the College. The faculty member in-charge of the project takes the responsibility for deliverables. The Company engineers/executives continuously involve in guiding the student either physically or virtually along with the faculty member In-charge.</p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-md ml-5 font-bold text-blue-800 mt-3">a) College has taken up three research projects with BT & BT Private Limited briefly described below:</p>
        <p className="text-md ml-5 font-bold text-purple-600 text-center">1. Robo Quality Inspections(RQI)</p>
        <p className="text-md ml-5 font-normal m-3 border-solid md:border-2 text-center bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">In the real estate industry (Villas, Flats, Commercial Building, Hotels etc.), before handing over the constructed asset to customers, Builders/ Contractors does many inspections to find defects (also called punches or snags). Today it is manual process, requires qualified and competent quality inspectors very difficult to get. As it is manual process, it’s also very time consuming.Hence there is a need to digitalize. An Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based algorithm to be developed which will be integrated with a small drone or robot. There are 100s of defects like cracks, breaking of pipes, misalignment of switch boards, broken tiles, improper plastering, etc. Once the robot/ drone is integrated with this algorithm we do not need qualified and competent quality inspectors, we need just robot/ drone operators (10th standard or less), who will go to a room (Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen etc.) and operate the robot/drone which automatically scan through room, take photographs and using algorithm automatically creates defect report.</p>
        <p className="text-md ml-5 font-bold text-purple-600 text-center"> 2. Robo Citizen Advisor (RCA)</p>
        <div className="text-md ml-5 font-normal m-3 border-solid md:border-2  bg-blue-100 rounded-sm text-center">
            <p>This project is to develop a CHAT BOT that is intelligent enough to provide required information and advices on legal issues.On the challenges the Citizens face Most of the problems can be resolved by providing accurate information and suggestions. The issues may include Child Abuse, Women Safety, Consumer Issues & Compensation (e.g. Tenant and Landlord, Supplier quality).</p>
            <p>When a citizen put a question using natural language processing and Machine Learning algorithms, Robo Citizen Advisor must be able to provide following services: Voice Recognition, Text responses, automatically draft legal letters and send to concerned parties. 4. Provide advice for the legal disputes/ problems, and File compliant to regulators or law & order.</p>

            <p className="ml-5" >The tool to be developed is that it crawls through the social media sites of the organizations like Facebook and Twitter and using natural language process, Machine Learning algorithms. Algorithms covering following features are to be develop by this project:</p>
            <p>a) Crawl through Facebook and Twitter sites of the organization</p>
            <p>b) Using NPL and AI segregate the Tweets or FB Posts into “compliant” or appreciation, or suggestion</p>
            <p>c) Create an Editor to refine / modify the unstructured text and allocate a Request # , Category and Subcategory of the request</p>
            <p>d) Develop an API to send the Social Media requests to Customer Compliant Management Software System</p>
            <p>All the three projects are guided by a Faculty member and an Executive of BT & BT. Eight students, from different disciplines, work in each project.</p>
